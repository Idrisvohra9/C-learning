# C-learning is a repository made by @Idrisvohra9 me. During my learning time of C language which still goes on. There are more than 60 little programs that are based on **CLI** and it covers the basics of C as a programming language There are many advantages of these programs that makes them more powerful when it comes to making the other users learn the things that are in the programs themselves. 

## Some of the advantages of C-learning repository:
##
1. There are many comments for better understanding of each and every term.
2. The program themselves are numbered that makes them all the more arranged and systematic. The testing ones are just the main programming files.
3. The codes are still being updated as we go and new codes are continuously being added.

# So in short The depository is fit for my own personal space and for the beginners also to understand the concepts of c language terms by the easy definitions via commenting.
